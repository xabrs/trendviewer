## Quick Reference:

 - To expand all child elements of the tree, hold down the Ctrl key while clicking on an item.
 - Plot discrete parameters in a separate chart.
 - If the CSV file doesn't include a date, the date and time will be relative to a default date. You can later shift the chart to the correct time.
 - Modern computers can easily display 1,000,000 data points thanks to WebGL. Ensure your data source isn't overloaded by such large queries.
 - Chart sizes can be adjusted. In the bottom right corner, thereâ€™s a standard resizing element, though it may be hard to notice.
 - Formulas use standard JS functions. The current value is substituted in place of *v*. Make sure to enclose expressions in parentheses when needed. For example, `0-v` won't work if *v* is less than zero. Use `0-(v)` instead.
 - Recalculation by formula or time shift does not trigger a new data request.
 - Multiple Y axes are NOT SUPPORTED!!!
